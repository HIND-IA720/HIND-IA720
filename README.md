# Hi, I’m Hind 👋

I study **AI and Data Science**, but learning, to me, is not the accumulation of models or tools.  
It is the practice of understanding how raw information turns into decisions — how subtle design choices quietly shape what a system notices, ignores, and ultimately learns. When I train a model, accuracy is never the final question; I ask instead what the model is being *guided to care about*.

AI systems, I’ve learned, are defined as much by their **learning signals** as by their architectures.  
Loss functions, rewards, and constraints are not neutral mechanics — they are assumptions encoded into the system. This perspective has changed how I approach machine learning: I focus on learning dynamics rather than outcomes alone, treat failures as information rather than errors, and see optimization not as mere minimization, but as a form of intentional guidance.
